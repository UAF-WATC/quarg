The channel also experienced an outage that began on 2020-11-08 and continued through the end of the reporting period. This outage is likely associated with the passage of a winter storm through the area that affected other elements/channels in this array.

There are lower-amplitude but similar waveforms on adjacent elements, but it is difficult to determine if this is a wind event due to a malfunctioning weather station."

18,Support,IM NV?? - SHZ,2020-11-02,Amplitudes,Noise characteristics at NVAR,hiAmp,/Users/ken/quarg/quarg_plots/NV01_PDF.png,,,New,,"All short-periods seismometers of the NVAR array exceed the 'hiAmp' threshold. While we expect short-period instruments to have greater noise than broadband, these exceed even this relaxed threshold. This is probably not an issue and just means we should further relax the QuARG 'hiAmp' threshold for short-periods channels. "
