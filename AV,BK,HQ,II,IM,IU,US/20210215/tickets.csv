This issues has been corrected in our metadata inventory and will soon be installed. However, the ticket will remain open until the station passes thresholds. Metadata has been updated for the 2020-12-14 period. This has improved noise spectra, but noise remains elevated enough to still exceed thresholds. Ticket will remain open pending a discussion with the A-Team.

UPDATE: After metadata changes, the spectra now look like what IRIS computes. However, the spectra still consistently breaks high amp thresholds. 

UPDATE: Exceeded the hiAmp threshold on 2021-02-10. The long-period noise on this day appears associated with teleseisms from the Loyalty Islands M7.7. However, the raw data does not look great. Also, comparing the deconvolved waveform to another broadband with similar offset indicates the low-quality of the GUMO data. Switching Category to ""Amplitudes"".

UPDATE: Not flagged week of 2021-02-15. Will keep open one more week. "

UPDATE: Elements 01, 02, 03, and 06 had many spikes on 2021-02-04.
