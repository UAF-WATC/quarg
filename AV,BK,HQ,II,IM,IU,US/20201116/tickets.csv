While there continues to be elevated mid-period noise, threshold exceedance usually seems to be associated with mass recenters. There has been once a week for the last 2 weeks. I'll keep this ticket open and keep an eye on the mrcs going forward. Closing this ticket as noise thresholds were not exceeded for this reporting period."
29,Data Problems,IM FSAH2 I[1-6] HDF,2020-11-09,Amplitudes,"Noise on Infrasound, Gaps and outages",hiAmp,/Users/ken/quarg/quarg_plots/2020_11_16/FSAH2_I4_PDF_2020_11_19.png;;;;/Users/ken/quarg/quarg_plots/2020_11_16/FSAH2_I4_PDF_2020_11_20.png,Elevated noise - possible wind event;;;;Station was below noise thresholds on this day,,In Progress,,All elements were out on 2020-11-16 and 2020-11-17 and came back late on 2020-11-18. There was high noise on elements I4-I6 om 2020-11-19 and 2020-11-21. The noise spectra did not exceed the hiAmp threshold on 2020-11-20. It is likely that these are just wind-induced transient noise events. The ticket will remain open until this can be verified against wind data.
