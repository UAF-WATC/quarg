This issues has been corrected in our metadata inventory and will soon be installed. However, the ticket will remain open until the station passes thresholds. Metadata has been updated for the 2020-12-14 period. This has improved noise spectra, but noise remains elevated enough to still exceed thresholds. Ticket will remain open pending a discussion with the A-Team.

UPDATE: After metadata changes, the spectra now look like what IRIS computes. However, the spectra still consistently breaks high amp thresholds. "
