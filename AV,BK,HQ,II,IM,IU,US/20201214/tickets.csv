We have approached Randy about this sensor but it is not resolved. This ticket remains open. I looked at bit more closely at this. Apparently, ground motions were recorded up until 2019-11-28, at which point there was an outage. The data returned on 2020-01-16, but only as digitizer noise. I have an email out to Randy to see if we can update out metadata with an end date of 2019-11-28 for this sensor."

Added the 'dead' threshold, based on the 'dead_channel_gsn' metric. Looked more closely at when this problem began. Looks like data went out around 2019-11-28T03:35:00 and came back as digitizer noise on 2020-01-16T01:30:00. I have an email out to Randy to see if this sensor should be closed in our metadata."

This issues has been corrected in our metadata inventory and will soon be installed. However, the ticket will remain open until the station passes thresholds. Metadata has been updated for the 2020-12-14 period. This has improved noise spectra, but noise remains elevated enough to still exceed thresholds. Ticket will remain open pending a discussion with the A-Team."

Pattern in similar for all elements.;;;;Number of gaps affects percent_availability for all elements.,,In Progress,,"All elements of the ADKI array exhibit large numbers of gaps in the CDF channels for the entire reporting period.

While there continues to be elevated mid-period noise, threshold exceedance usually seems to be associated with mass recenters. There has been once a week for the last 2 weeks. I'll keep this ticket open and keep an eye on the mrcs going forward. Re-opened this ticket as there have been continued mass recenters that exceeded the hiamp threshold. SHEM did not break the hiAmp threshold this reporting period. However, because it has exhibited consistent mass recenters, I will leave this ticket open for at least one more week."
