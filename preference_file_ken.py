# The preference file is a place to define values that will be used for
# reports each time a report is generated. This is to reduce the amount
# that the analyst needs to input each time, since they can set up a 
# preference file once and use that for each subsequent report.
#
# General categories include:
#    Target information
#    Report frequency
#    Thresholds to use
#    Directory and filenames for common files
#    Report header information
# 
# The preference file is a python script that is loaded during various parts of the 
# QuARG report generation process.  As such, variable names cannot be changed.
# For example, groupsDict cannot be renamed unless the same change is 
# made in every other script that calls on 'groupsDict'.  But, the contents of groupsDict
# can be changed, so you can choose which thresholds belong to which thresholds groups.
# 
# For a more detailed description of each variable, see below.

# Detailed description of each field.
#
## Target and instrument information:
#   network - Two letter network code, ex IU.
#   station - Station codes to be used in report. Can be wildarded or lists. Default is "*" for all stations in network.
#   channels - Channels to use in the report. Can be wildcarded and/or lists. Currently we only have thresholds for broadband and short period instruments
#           so make sure that the channels listed here fall within one or both of those categories.
#   location - Location codes to use in the report.
#   instruments - Type of instruments included in the report. Currently we only have thresholds for broadband and short period 
#               instruments. This field is used to know which thresholds to print on the end of the HTML network report.
#  
#  
## Report Frequency: 
#   reportFrequency - how often reports will be generated. Options include: 'Quarterly', 'Monthly', 'Weekly', 'Daily'
#   startday - First day of the report, generated using calculate_dates for the frequency specified in reportFrequency
#   endday - Final day of the report, generated using calculate_dates for the frequency specified in reportFrequency
#   subdir - The subdirectory that to be used for the report, generated using calculate_dates for the frequency specified in reportFrequency.
#         If the reportFrequency is 'Quarterly' or 'Monthly' then the directory will be YYYYmm. If the report is more frequent,
#         'Weekly' or 'Daily' then the directory will be YYYYmmdd
#  
#
## Thresholds:
#   thresholdGroups - List of all threshold groups to be used to find issues. Groups include: 'Completeness','Amplitudes','Timing','State of Health','Metadata'
#   groupsDict - Where each threshold group is defined. Thresholds can be added or removed to various threshold groups here. The actual definition of a given 
#         threshold happens in the thresholds.py file.
#           
#        All default groupings are as follows:
#           groupsDict = {'Completeness':['avgGaps','gapsRatioGt12','noData'],
#                         'Amplitudes' : ['flat','lowRms','hiAmp','lowAmp','badResp',
#                                         'avgSpikes','pegged','dead','noise1','noise2',
#                                          'medianUnique','rmsRatio','xTalk',
#                                         'gainRatio','nonCoher','polarity',
#                                         'dcOffsets','nSpikes','rmsRatio'],
#                         'Timing' : ['poorTQual','suspectTime','noTime'],
#                        'State of Health' : ['ampSat','filtChg','clip',
#                                             'spikes','glitch','padding','tSync'],
#                         'Metadata' : ['zDip','horDip','zeroZ','lowScale','nonMSUnits']}
#
#
## Directories and Filenames:
#   directory - Directory where all files will be written and found
#   filename - Filename for the issue file that is generated during the FIND ISSUES portion of the reporting process
#   outfile - Full pathname for the issue file
#   csvfile - Full pathname for an intermediate csv file, generated from the tickets and used to generate the final report
#   
#   
## Report Header Information:   
#   author - Name of the person that prepared the report
#   project - Information about the particular report. This is a bit more flexible and describe what is covered in the report.
#             For example, it could be something like "UU ::  University of Utah Regional Network"
#             Or, if you have multiple reports for the same network, it could be something like "UU :: Broadband Channels"
